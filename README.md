# 🧮 Scientific Calculator in C++  

This **Scientific Calculator** is built in **C++** and provides a wide range of mathematical operations, from basic arithmetic to advanced trigonometric and logarithmic functions. The program features a **console-based interface** with efficient error handling to ensure smooth calculations.  

## ✨ Features  

✔ **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
✔ **Exponentiation & Logarithms:** Supports exponent calculations and logarithmic functions  
✔ **Base Conversions:** Convert numbers between different bases  
✔ **Trigonometry:** Sin, cos, tan, sec, cosec, cot (both degrees & radians)  
✔ **Inverse Trigonometry:** Sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, tan⁻¹, sec⁻¹, cosec⁻¹, cot⁻¹  
✔ **Hyperbolic Functions:** Sinh, cosh, tanh, and their inverses  
✔ **Angle Conversions:** Convert between degrees and radians  
✔ **Percentage Calculations:** Compute percentages easily  

## 🚀 How to Use  

1. Clone the repository:  
   git clone https://github.com/AashirGilani/scientific-calculator.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   cd scientific-calculator
   
4. Compile and run the program:  
   g++ -o calculator main.cpp calc.cpp -lm
   ./calculator
   
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.  

## 🛠 Dependencies  

- **C++ Standard Library** (`cmath`, `cstdlib`, `iomanip`, `iostream`, `vector`, `string`)  
- A **C++ compiler** such as **G++** (for Linux/macOS) or **MinGW** (for Windows).  

## 📌 Future Enhancements  

🔹 Add a **graphical user interface (GUI)** for better usability  
🔹 Implement **complex number calculations**  
🔹 Improve error handling and input validation
